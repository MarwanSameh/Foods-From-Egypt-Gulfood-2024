f_brief: '"Beyti is one of the largest producers of milk, juice and yogurt in
  Egypt, targeting a market of 100 million consumers and catering to different
  consumer profiles. Beyti was established in 1998 with the acquisition of the
  largest commercial dairy farm in Egypt from the Saudi Group Dallah Al-Baraka.
  Today, Beyti produces a number of agri-food products, from 100% natural milk
  to a variety of spoonable and drinkable yogurts, as well as cooking and
  whipping creams, for domestic consumption and export sales. Our name, the word
  ‘Beyti’ in Arabic, has the dual meaning of ‘my home’/ or ‘home-made,
  reflecting the fact that our products are wholesome and contain no
  preservatives or any harmful additives. Beyti quality control measures ensure
  that our products are fresh and natural, making it easy for our customers to
  maintain a healthy lifestyle. We first began marketing Beyti-branded milk on
  the Egyptian market in 2002, using a novel bottle packaging that set us apart
  from the competition. The success of our dairy line led us to expand into
  juice in 2007, followed closely by our creams line. We export to 45 countries
  in Africa- EU- N.America – Asia."'
