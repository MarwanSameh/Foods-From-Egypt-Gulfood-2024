f_brief: >-
  "Beyti is one of the largest producers of milk, juice and yogurt in Egypt,
  targeting a market of 100 million consumers and catering to different consumer
  profiles. Beyti was established in 1998 with the acquisition of the largest
  commercial dairy farm in Egypt from the Saudi Group Dallah Al-Baraka. Today,
  Beyti produces a number of agri-food products, from 100% natural milk to a
  variety of spoonable and drinkable yogurts, as well as cooking and whipping
  creams, for domestic consumption and export sales. Our name, the word ‘Beyti’
  in Arabic, has the dual meaning of ‘my home’/ or ‘home-made, reflecting the
  fact that our products are wholesome and contain no preservatives or any
  harmful additives. Beyti quality control measures ensure that our products are
  fresh and natural, making it easy for our customers to maintain a healthy
  lifestyle. We first began marketing Beyti-branded milk on the Egyptian market
  in 2002, using a novel bottle packaging that set us apart from the
  competition. The success of our dairy line led us to expand into juice in
  2007, followed closely by our creams line. We export to 45 countries in
  Africa- EU- N.America – Asia."
