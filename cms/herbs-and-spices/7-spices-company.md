f_brief: '"Seven Spices has deep roots in the development, production and
  marketing of seeds, spices, herbs and agricultural products. Our history
  begins in 1955, when the Bawadekji family started their business in Aleppo,
  Syria as a family growing business.  Along the decades, the results were so
  positive that the commerce expanded to Turkey and Egypt. Al-Tahuna currently
  is our sister company, and one of the most famous corporations in Syria and
  Turkey that is specialized in importing, exporting and marketing a wide range
  of natural products."'
