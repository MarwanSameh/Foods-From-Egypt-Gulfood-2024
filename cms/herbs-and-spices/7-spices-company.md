f_brief: >-
  Seven Spices has deep roots in the development, production and marketing of
  seeds, spices, herbs and agricultural products.

  Our history begins in 1955, when the Bawadekji family started their business
  in Aleppo, Syria as a family growing business. 

  Along the decades, the results were so positive that the commerce expanded to
  Turkey and Egypt.

  Al-Tahuna currently is our sister company, and one of the most famous
  corporations in Syria and Turkey that is specialized in importing, exporting
  and marketing a wide range of natural products.
