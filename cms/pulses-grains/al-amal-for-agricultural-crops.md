  Al Amal Co-founded in 1975 for the purpose of trading in agricultural crops

  The main trading of our company was inside the Arab Republic of Egypt;
  including selling buying, storing, and manufacturing crops.

  until 1991, due to the progress achieved and huge demand for our products, the
  company adopted a phenomenal policy of opening new markets for both exporting
  and importing crops.

  Al Amal has exported the best quality crops to all over the world...
