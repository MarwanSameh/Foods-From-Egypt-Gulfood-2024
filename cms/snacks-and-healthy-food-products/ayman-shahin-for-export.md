  cakes, sticks, and a kid's range of cakes and sticks called Boboo. Astra is
  our brand of lollipops and bonbons with massive flavors. Moussy is one of the
  biggest beverage manufacturers in the Mediterranean West. Itâ€™s a partnership
  with Carlsberg company to produce Moussy in Egypt which is a malt beverage. Al
  Tahya is a brand of beans- legumes.
